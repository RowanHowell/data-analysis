Scripts to analyse Thorpe lab data

SPIscripts functions can be used directly on raw files eg AllStats files from ScreenMill.

MMfuns functions should be used on the outputs from SPIscripts. They can be used to apply mixture model analysis, create files combining validation and original screen data and predict screen validation rates.
